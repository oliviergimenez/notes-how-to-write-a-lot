-   Allot time to write
-   Close Internet access, turn off phone, shut the door
-   The simple fact of sitting down to write day after day is what makes writers productive
-   Set project goals once a month, and concrete objectives every writing day (p.42), then prioritize
-   Improve writing (intro = overview, review, the study)
